# EchoCheck: Paraphrase-Detection-BERT

Welcome to EchoCheck, a state-of-the-art paraphrase detection system leveraging BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to identify semantically equivalent sentences. This project combines traditional NLP techniques and deep learning to enhance the accuracy and robustness of paraphrase detection, evaluated on benchmark datasets.

## Key Features

- **BERT Integration**: Utilizes BERT to encode sentences into dense, contextualized representations.
- **Data Augmentation**: Implements novel strategies to enhance model robustness against diverse paraphrase variations.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Assesses model performance on benchmark datasets, demonstrating competitive results.

## Datasets

- **Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRP)**: A benchmark dataset with sentence pairs labeled as paraphrases or non-paraphrases.
- **Paraphrase Adversaries from Word Scrambling (PAWS)**: A challenging dataset with lexically and structurally similar but semantically different sentence pairs.
